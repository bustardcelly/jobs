I am a software engineer with a passion for architecture, development workflows, agile practices and Test Driven Development.  

Over the past 12 years, I have helped deliver web, mobile and desktop solutions with numerous companies in the enterprise and entertainment industries including Adobe, THQ, Condé Nast Publications and Motorola.

I write frequently about software and technology on my [blog](http://www.custardbelly.com/blog) and give back to the development community by releasing Open Source Software on [GitHub](https://github.com/bustardcelly). I am also a co-author on [several titles](http://www.amazon.com/Todd-Anderson/e/B0037FMULM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_2) from O'Reilly Media and Wiley Wrox publishing.
